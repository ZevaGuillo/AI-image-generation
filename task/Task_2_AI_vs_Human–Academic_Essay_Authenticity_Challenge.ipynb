The problems they are experiencing happen not only at school, but also at home, and it seems that without adult guidance, our young generation will continue to struggle.Teenage years have never been simple, and many would agree that the amount of challenges has only increased with the passage of time. Bullying has been a problem for quite a while, and children and adolescents would have experienced it at school in the past, but then it would stop at home. At present, however, things have been made worse by social media penetrating the supposedly safe space of our teenagers. The unfortunate behaviour of their peers can now reach them even in their bedrooms, causing them constant distress.Another issue troubling many young people is the pressure to succeed by their families. Whether at school or at home, they often feel as if they are not smart enough, which creates overwhelm and despair. Understandably, their parents are pursuing a worthy goal of ensuring their children get a great start in life; however, many teens feel that they are failing their families when they don\\u2019t live up to their expectations. This often leads to dishonest and unethical behaviour, such as cheating on tests or plagiarising other students\\u2019 work. When uncovered, these incidents have a profound effect on young people\\u2019s future careers, not to mention their emotional well-being.It is hard to underestimate the importance of parental support to navigating life as a young person. From helping teens build a positive body image and self-esteem, to handling classmates\\u2019 difficult behaviour, to guidance where study is concerned, parents can make a world of difference. Talking to their sons and daughters about matters that worry them, listening and making non-judgmental suggestions are great ways to help. Getting a professional involved where necessary and engaging with teachers, councilors and coaches is another opportunity for parents to provide assistance. Last but not least, parents can make their children better and happier people by simply giving them unconditional love.To sum up, being a young person in the modern world isn\\u2019t easy. By banding together and paying careful attention to their teens, families can help them overcome any obstacles to becoming successful adults.\",\n          \"While some may argue that the primary purpose of education is to prepare students for the workforce, I strongly disagree with this statement. Education is a multifaceted institution that serves various purposes, and its primary goal should not be limited to workforce preparation.\\n\\nFirstly, education plays a crucial role in shaping individuals' critical thinking and problem-solving skills. By exposing students to diverse subjects and ideas, education helps them develop analytical minds, enabling them to navigate complex situations and make informed decisions. These skills are essential not only in the workforce but also in personal and civic life. For instance, a well-educated individual can critically evaluate information, identify biases, and make sound judgments, which are vital for effective participation in democratic processes.\\n\\nSecondly, education fosters personal growth and development, allowing individuals to explore their interests and passions. By providing opportunities for students to engage in extracurricular activities, sports, and creative pursuits, education helps them discover their strengths and weaknesses, build confidence, and develop a sense of purpose. This, in turn, enables them to lead fulfilling lives, regardless of their career choices. For example, a student who excels in music or art may not necessarily pursue a career in these fields but can still benefit from the skills and values they acquired through their education.\\n\\nLastly, education has a profound impact on individuals' social and emotional well-being. By promoting empathy, tolerance, and understanding, education helps students develop positive relationships with others, build strong communities, and contribute to the greater good. This is evident in the many examples of educators and alumni who have made significant contributions to social justice, environmental sustainability, and humanitarian causes.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while education can certainly prepare students for the workforce, its primary purpose should be to empower individuals with the knowledge, skills, and values necessary to lead fulfilling lives, contribute to society, and make a positive impact on the world.\",\n          \"I disagree with the statement that the development of artificial intelligence will create more jobs than it will eliminate. While it is true that AI has the potential to automate certain tasks, I believe that its impact on job creation will be limited.\\n\\nFirstly, AI will undoubtedly replace many jobs that are repetitive, routine, and can be easily automated. For instance, self-service kiosks are already replacing cashiers in many retail stores. Similarly, AI-powered chatbots are taking over customer service roles. These jobs will be eliminated, and many workers will struggle to adapt to the changing job market.\\n\\nMoreover, the development of AI will also lead to the creation of new jobs in fields such as AI development, deployment, and maintenance. However, these jobs will require highly specialized skills and education, which not everyone possesses. In addition, the number of new jobs created in these fields will likely be limited compared to the number of jobs eliminated.\\n\\nFurthermore, the benefits of AI, such as increased productivity and efficiency, will likely be concentrated among a small group of companies and individuals, rather than being evenly distributed across the workforce. This could exacerbate income inequality and create new social and economic challenges.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while AI has the potential to bring about significant benefits, I believe that its impact on job creation will be limited. The jobs that are eliminated will likely outweigh the new jobs created, and the benefits of AI will be concentrated among a small group of individuals. Therefore, I disagree with the statement that the development of artificial intelligence will create more jobs than it will eliminate.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"human\",\n          \"ai\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
